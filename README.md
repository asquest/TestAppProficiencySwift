## About App

The TestAppProficiencySwift is a app that uses programtic constraints to load the UI. It fetches data from a url and load data into a tableview. It loads images lazily and keeps the app as fluid as possible. 
The app basically consists of one screen

## Features

1) Codable Protocol: Codable protocol is used to convert json data fetched into swift object directly.

2) Caching Used: Images in the tableview are loaded lazily by using caching mechanism so that images dont load evrytime tableview is scrolled.

3) Advanced Contraints: Advanced constraints or programtic constraints are used with no storyboard or xib involved.

4) Networking Module: Networking module created while doing networking calls using URLSessions.

## Unit Tests
